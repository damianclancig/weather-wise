## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#192A56) as the main background to create a serene and modern feel.
- Background color: Slightly desaturated dark blue (#273c75) for a cohesive, dark interface.
- Accent color: Light gray/silver (#D3D3D3) for borders and highlights, providing a metallic, glassmorphic effect.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern, readable interface.
- Use animated weather icons to visually represent weather conditions.
- Glassmorphism effect for cards to enhance the elegance and modern aesthetic of the UI. Ensure good readability with appropriate contrast.
- Implement animated borders for the cards, simulating a glowing effect. This can be achieved using a rotating, circular gradient to give the impression of shimmering edges.
